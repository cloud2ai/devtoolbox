## About This Project

Two years ago, in December 2023, ChatGPT burst onto the scene and immediately caught my attention. At first, I thought it was just an improved version of existing AI technology. But after using it, I quickly realized that this was a groundbreaking product. I even believed that this might be the last big entrepreneurial opportunity for those of us born in the 1980s.

I still remember that day very clearly. It was a Friday, and coincidentally, it was also the day I caught COVID for the first time. In the morning, I started feeling unwell but still pushed through my work. At noon, I took some fever medicine and rested for a bit. By 3 PM, I joined our weekly company meeting. It was during this meeting that I introduced ChatGPT to my colleagues for the first time. From that moment on, I fully committed myself to exploring ChatGPT applications.

For nearly 10 years, I had been working in software development at the infrastructure level, and over time, I started feeling burnt out. But when ChatGPT emerged, I made a firm decision to shift my focus to application development. Over the next two years, I experimented with various ChatGPT-powered applications—from video translation and voiceovers to automated multimodal news generation, an I Ching fortune-telling mini-program, and eventually implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) within my company. Along the way, I developed a significant amount of AI-related code.

During this journey, I also gained a growing presence on multiple platforms. **I surpassed 10,000 followers on Douyin and Toutiao, and over 6,000 followers on CSDN.** My explorations in AI applications and automated content generation attracted considerable attention. These achievements reinforced my belief that in the AI era, success depends on finding real-world applications and monetization strategies.

However, as I worked on more and more projects, I realized that I hadn't properly organized or abstracted my learnings. That’s why I now want to develop a new foundational AI application library—one that consolidates my technical experience and provides a more efficient foundation for future AI development.

在两年前的 2023 年 12 月，ChatGPT 横空出世，一下子闯入了我的视野。起初，我以为这只是现有 AI 技术的优化升级版，但在亲身体验后，我立刻意识到——这是一款颠覆性的产品。甚至，我认为这或许是我们 80 后最后一次能够抓住的创业机会。

那一天的情景我依然记忆犹新。那是一个周五，恰好也是我第一次感染新冠的日子。上午，我已经感觉到身体有些异样，但仍然坚持完成了工作。中午吃了退烧药小憩片刻后，下午 3 点参加了公司的周例会。就在这次例会上，我第一次向全体同事介绍了 ChatGPT。从那一刻起，我开始全身心投入 ChatGPT 应用的研究。

过去近 10 年，我长期从事基础架构层的软件开发，渐渐感到倦怠。而当 ChatGPT 出现后，我毫不犹豫地选择从应用层切入。接下来的两年里，我不断尝试利用 ChatGPT 进行各种应用探索——从最早的视频翻译与配音，到自动化多模态新闻，再到后来的易经算命小程序，直至如今在公司内部推行 RAG（检索增强生成），开发了大量与 AI 应用相关的代码。

在这一过程中，我也逐渐在多个平台上积累了一定的影响力。我的 **抖音和今日头条粉丝突破 1 万**，**CSDN 关注人数超过 6000**，在 AI 技术应用、自动化内容生成等领域的探索吸引了不少的关注。这些成果不仅验证了 AI 在应用层的可行性，也让我更加坚定地认为，AI 时代的关键在于如何真正落地和变现。

然而，随着项目的不断增多，我发现自己尚未对这些经验进行系统化的整理和抽象。因此，我希望开发一个全新的 AI 应用开发基础库，沉淀自己的技术积累，为后续的 AI 研发提供更高效的支持。
